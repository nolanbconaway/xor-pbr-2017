'In this part of the experiment, you will be shown more images. Your job is to learn to tell whether each example belongs to the "Alpha" or "Beta" category. As you are shown each example, you will be asked to make a category judgment and then you will recieve feedback. At first you will have to guess, but you will gain experience as you go along. After you have completed your training, we will ask you a series of test questions about what you have learned.\n\nPress the spacebar when you are ready to continue.'],
