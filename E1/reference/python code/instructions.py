    job is to learn to tell whether each example belongs to the Alpha or Beta category.\n\
    As you are shown each example, you will be asked to make a category judgment\n\
    and then you will recieve feedback. At first you will have to guess, but you will\n\
    gain experience as you go along. After you have completed your training, we will\n\
    ask you a series of test questions about what you have learned.\n\
