When we originally ran this, it was four conditions where we twisted up the XOR category structure, so we called it the "twistedxor" experiment. We called it `twistedxor2` due to a failed pilot early on.

Only the partial-XOR condition data (condition #2) was published in the PBR paper, though all four are discussed [in my master's thesis](https://search.proquest.com/openview/4db978232e9fdd1d6eaaa656e08b879d/). We also wrote a [cogsci proceedings](https://nolanbconaway.github.io/pdfs/manuscripts/conaway-kurtz-cogsci2015.pdf) on the full and partial XOR conditions (1 & 2)

You'll find references to all four conditions scattered about.
