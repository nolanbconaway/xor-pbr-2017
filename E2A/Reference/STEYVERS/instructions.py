    ['training',
'In this experiment, you will be shown examples of geometric images. \n\
The examples belong to two different kinds, and your job is to learn to\n\
tell which ones are from which category: Alpha or Beta.\n\
  \n\
As you are shown each example, you will be asked to decide its category.\n\
You will receive feedback on each trial to help you learn.  At first you will\n\
just have to guess, but you will gain experience as you go.  It may not be\n\
easy, but before long, you should develop a good sense of the two categories.\n\
After the training, there will be a set of questions to show what you have learned.\n\
\n\
Press the spacebar when you are ready to continue.'],

each example belongs to.  This time you will not receive feedback.\n\
